==== Here's how to generate ssl-keys for local usage: ====

# Install mkcert
brew install mkcert

# Generates key 'example.com+5-key.pem' and cert 'example.com+5.pem' files in current directory for domains 'example.com', example.test, localhost... 
mkcert example.com "*.example.com" example.test localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1

# Use the path to these files in your development.env like so:
SSLKEYPATH='SHOULD NOT BE EMPTY'
SSLCERTPATH='SHOULD NOT BE EMPTY'

# Restart server and should work


==== LIVE SERVER SSL STUFF BELOW ====

On the server this is where the ssl-certification stuff is located at:

Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/gymbook.pro/fullchain.pem
Key is saved at:         /etc/letsencrypt/live/gymbook.pro/privkey.pem
This certificate expires on 2022-08-23.
These files will be updated when the certificate renews.
Certbot has set up a scheduled task to automatically renew this certificate in the background.
