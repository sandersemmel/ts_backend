# START
- This is a express ts/node backend I worked on. I have removed a lot of files so it won't compile :)
- It's just uploaded for demo purposes
- I was using SQLLite db and pinged the express server with REST for simple CRUD operations
- I was using firebase for auth and Sequelize for orm


# How to start the program in development mode:
´npm run nodemon_start´ to start the nodemon server and copy the files to dist

´npm run ts_compile´ to keep compiling the files upon changes
